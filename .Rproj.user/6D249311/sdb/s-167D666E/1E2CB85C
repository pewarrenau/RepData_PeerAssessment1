The activity.zip file contains only one file activity.csv, so I didn't bother building too many smarts into my routine.\nStep 2 - Read the data into a Data.Frame.\n\n```{r}\n\nunzip(\"activity.zip\")\ndata <- read.csv(\"activity.csv\")\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?\nStep 3 - Aggregated the steps by date, using sum as the fucntion\nStep 4 - Plotted Histogram of aggregated step data\n```{r}\naggdata <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=data, sum)\nhist(aggdata$steps, breaks = 25)\n```\n\nStep 5 and 6 - Calculate the Mean and Medium\n```{r}\nmean(aggdata$steps)\nmedian(aggdata$steps)\n```\n\n\n## What is the average daily activity pattern?\nStep 7 - Aggregate the steps by internal period, using mean as the function\nStep 8 - Produced line plot, with interval as the x-axis and steps for the y-axis\n```{r}\naggdata2 <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=data, mean)\nplot(aggdata2, type = \"l\")\n\n```\n\nStep 9 - Ordered the aggregated step data, and then selected the first instance to show the highest step date in the set.\n```{r}\nx <- order(aggdata2$steps, decreasing = TRUE)\naggdata2[x[1],]\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Imputing missing values\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?\n",
